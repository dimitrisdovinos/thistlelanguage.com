      Our General English courses for teenagers are designed to improve on
      their previous English knowledge and help them manoeuvre effectively and
      confidently onto the next level. They are interactive and supportive
      courses designed to challenge your teen and provide a positive,
      meaningful learning experience. Courses are developmentally appropriate
      and are taught with a variety of communicative techniques.

      Lesson content is focussed on real-world English, adapted to the needs of your teen,
      and repeated and recycled. Students in these classes will be encouraged
      to do group projects and guided towards greater learner autonomy.
